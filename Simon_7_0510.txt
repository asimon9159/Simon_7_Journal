1.) You would not initialize the hero in class hero because the class is just 
stating the parameters of the hero (i.e. how much health). You actually have 
to call the hero outside of the class because the hero himself if not a description 
of himself.

public class Hero() {
	int health = 100;
	int score = 0;
	String username;
	boolean weapon;
	int speed = 5;
	int sight = 5;
	int level = 0;
	int x = 0;
	int y = 0;
	int z = 0;
	String symbol = 'X';

	public static void intro(){
		Scanner theirname = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("What's your name?");
		username = theirname.nextLine();
		System.out.println("Pick a number between 1 and 10");
		int y = userinput0.newLine();
		System.out.println("Pick another number");
		int x = userinput1.newLine();
		map[n][m] = 'X';	
}
}
