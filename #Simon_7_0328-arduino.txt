1.) I have seen some uses of arrays, but in a different sense with the use of objects or 
variables like sound as well as if statements scattered throughout. However, there seems to 
be similar programming such as (for) loops. 

2.) I will create and arrange different notes to create snippets of songs, make different 
opportunities for user input or display.

3.) A circuit is required to have a starting connecting point and an end point (a positive and a 
negative), as well as a power source.

4.) Programs are compiled with arduino by the code being uploaded to Arduino's storage in a 
package.

5.) Many projects I have completed have taught me how certain objects need to be connected to 
each other in order to work (such as an LED would need to be connected to power). For some 
projects to work, there are certain items needed to help run the project to complete its goal 
that is also compatiable for the user to see/hear/etc (i.e. an LCD would need a display 
contrast pin to display the contrast of the LCD).

6.) My rough idea of my project will have the user press certain buttons in a specific order 
to light up a pallete. If the user presses the wrong button they get a strike, each sound 
sounding with more base/bass(?) (up to 3). At the end, if the user is successful, the entire 
song plays and the LEDs runs through the pallete. If the user isn't successful, the "music 
box" "explodes".
