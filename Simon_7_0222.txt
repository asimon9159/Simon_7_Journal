1.) I could try to understand the previous lessons even more, but if I'm honest, it's just more 
stress on something I may not be so confident in.
2.) Even though our orbs may not be working (though a slick orb game was provided, I rather not 
copy, but try to solve problems on my own), how heavy graded will our games be?
3.) I will probably have to dedicate more time to get the code working.
4.) Mentally, I feel like I am not prepared, but I am ready to take on the obstacles to understand 
and have all the knowledge that is needed. I just need to study and understand why and why not 
some things do what and how.
