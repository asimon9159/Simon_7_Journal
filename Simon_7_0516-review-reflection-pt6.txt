1.) Casting is changing one data-type to another. 
2.) Up-casting is changing one subclass to a superclass.
int chair = 2;
double table;
table = chair;
3.) Down-Casting is changing one superclass to a subclass. 
int chair = 2;
double = (int)chair; 
4.) The range of values for byte is -128 to 127, because each byte has around 8 for their standard storages.
5.) Converting a char to a String: 
char c = 'c';
String sally;
sally = '' + c;
