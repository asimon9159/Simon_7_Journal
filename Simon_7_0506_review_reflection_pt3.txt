1.) The x coordinate is 43 while the y coordinate is 67 because it is switched 
because j is inverse of x and i is inverse of y.
2.) if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); This prints 8888 if the y coordinate is 
on 0.
3.) System.out.print(map[i][j]); This prints the coordinations of the user if 
map[i][f] = 'x'.
4.) System.out.println("."); This prints out . if j!=0. it is different that #e 
because it uses a line separater.
5.) System.out.println(map[i][j]); This prints the coordinations of the user if 
i != 0.
6.) You can use a boolean with a while loop by putting your boolean inside the 
while loop or by calling it from the inside.
7.) Static keeps a variable constant or permanently conditionally.
8.) I could use an object with my game by having a shooter.
