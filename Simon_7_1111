1.) I will hope to try to make a game where you have to go find the exit, but in some rooms, there will 
be enemies/healing potions/misc. items/etc.
2.) Some challenges that I might face will be trying to make the enemies damage the user, adding things 
to inventory, making some elements (such as health) drop/rise, etc.
