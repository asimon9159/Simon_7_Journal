1.) I admit that I am not almost done with my methods because I started a couple of days late with the project since I started on the 
animation extra credit first.

2.) I wrote different shape and color methods throughout my coding. I felt I was being repetitive by writing the more-or-less the same 
thing, but only changing the types of colors or shapes or line widths.

3.) I did noticed the sample code on github because I was going to try the extra credit.

4.) I have not fully examined the sample code on github, though I did examine the codes somewhat because I wanted to see where I was 
starting off with.

5.) private void drawSquares (GraphicsContext gc) {
	for __________________
		gc.setFill(Colors.RED);
		gc.fillRect(15,15,10,10);
	} else if {
		gc.setFill(Colors.RED);
		gc.fillRect(10,10,5,5);
	{ else {
		gc.setFill(Colors.RED);
		gc.fillRect(5,5,15,15);
}
