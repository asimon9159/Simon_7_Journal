1.)In my game, I can track what challenges the player has solved by having a checklist for the user 
while in the code I can use if statements.
2.)I can track HP by using if statements (like if the character does so and so, they lose this many 
points).
3.)The user can use items if they find it in their environment. They can only collect items if they do certain actions.
