1.) I would assume that assembly is the combination or the creation of a project, 
program, or code. Assembly is a low level language.

2.) Assembly gives direct and complete control over system hardware.

3.) Assembly language programs are not portable. Learning the assembly is more 
difficult than learning java. Programming in the assembly language is a tedious 
and error-prone procress. High-level languages should be natural preference for 
common applications.

4.) High level language programs are portable, low levels are not. In high-level 
languages, the program development is faster, fewer lines of code, and the program 
maintenance is easier.

5.) Java is high level language, because it's a natural preference for common 
applications.

6.) Assembly is low level language, because programming in the assembly language 
is a tedious and error-prone process.
