1.) Arrays were used to group certain objects for a certain subject of the code. Such as when we 
were creating enemies that were skeletons, we would have an array to keep all the different 
skeletons under one name (ie.e bonez).
2.) In a different program, uses of arrays would be useful for catagorizing certain subjects or 
topics for a different part of the program.
