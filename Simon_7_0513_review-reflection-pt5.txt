I was one of those students who had no "recollection" of 2-D arrays, or arrays 
ing general, mainly because I feel we did not spend much time on talking about 
arrays (of what they were, how they worked, etc.). If I am real honest, I feel 
this is the same for any and every lesson that we covered this school-year and 
I would have wished that we spent more time practicing and perfecting these skills.
