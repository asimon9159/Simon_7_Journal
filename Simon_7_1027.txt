The process of creativity is whatever comes to your mind that represents you and/or your individuality.

I believe that there are no specific steps to be creative because being creative is whatever your mind wants to see or make.
However, some people can argue that specific steps to be creative is:
0.)Think about what road or path you want to take or how you want to handle the situation.
1.)Do it in a way that expresses yourself, but that also appeals to a specific audience
