1.) The purpose of the code art is to represent the most important part of my program and to show that I understand the 
use of JavaFX by placing that code with the artwork that we made. Also another purpose of creating the code art is 
because my computer science teacher, Mr. Davis, is taking up a code art grade, but that's besides the point.

2.) The purpose of creating art with code is to help the student understand/learn the use of methods/class in JavaFX by 
creating a piece of artwork using the knowledge that we have received.
