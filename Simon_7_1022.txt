1.) The purpose of the code art is to represent the most important part of my program and to show that I understand the 
use of JavaFX by placing that code with the artwork that we made. I created my code art so that the important part of my program is shown along with the picture itself as like a base. Also another purpose of creating the code art is 
because my computer science teacher, Mr. Davis, is taking up a code art grade, but that's besides the point.

2.) The purpose of creating art with code is to help the creator understand and learn the use of methods/class and how to ultilize methods/classes, as well as how to create art on JavaFX by creating a piece of artwork using the knowledge that we have received.
