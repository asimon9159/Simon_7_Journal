1.) This code initailizes the the "up" looking sprite for the player from the ogrespriesheet.
2.) It is unrealistic and unproductive to memorize Slick syntax because it will probably be 
gone and won't be used in the future (of 10-20 years from now). We are trying to practice the 
skill of how to problem-solve.
3.) An arraylist is a list of a bunch of different kinds of one element.
4.) You make an arraylist by following the format of String [] <element> = {"element1", "element2"}
5.) An array is a more general, more random kind of element.
6.) You make an array by following the format of for(int e = 0; e < element.length - 1; d++){
	System.out.println(element[e]);}
7.) The three useful arraylist methods that I identified are sort, fill, and stream.
8.) Arrays could be resized while ArrayLists only have a certain size. We used ArrayLists 
at the start of the code to state certain objects as a way to categorize these items. 
9.) You make a health counter for an avatar by using the code:
	public static int counter = 0;
	counter += delta;
	princessdie.health -= counter/1000;
