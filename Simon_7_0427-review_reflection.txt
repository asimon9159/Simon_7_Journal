1.) Students are encouraged to learn CS so that they not only know the facts, but they can connect those ideas to other leading 
patterns, skills, problems, etc. By memorizing CS, you are not really learning anything, you aren't taking in what CS has to offer. 
The student is not understanding the full extend, but rather they are "learning" the basic minimum.

2.) Students should learn what the basic commands, logistics, and ethics are from CS. By learning these things in CS, students 
will be able to understand and piece together ideas and problems that they are unable to solve. The importance of organizing one's 
thoughts and not proceeding in a haphazard manner is that the student knows what he is doing, and know which direction he is 
proceeding in. If theperson is proceeding in a risky way, he could make several mistakes in which he does not know what to do. At 
the beginning of the class this year, we talked about how if you can't help another student, that means that you don't understand 
what to do yourself.
