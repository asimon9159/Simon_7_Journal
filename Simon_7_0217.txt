1.) Arrays are objects that are used as containers for multiple and different values of the same type.
2.) The code for an int array is:
	private int something;
3.) The code for a string array is: 
	private String something = new String[];
4.) The code for a boolean arrray is:
	private boolean something; 
5.) The code for a double array is:
	private double something;
6.) You would change the first value of the int array to 42 by changing the code
7.) You would change it to say "Bob" by chaning int to boolean.
8.) This code is general and only gives three non-specific desserts that will probably chose from a list.
9.) This code is specific and only knows and will use only those three desserts (rice pudding, pan dulce, 
and banuelos) rather than some other dessert.
10.) Number 8 is more general and will pick any other dessert within the arraylist while number 9 is 
specific in its desserts.
11.) You would replace "bunuelos" with "apple pie" by switching the two desserts within the code.
