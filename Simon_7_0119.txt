1.) I tried creating a game where you were a princess and you had to make it out of the cave.

2.) I got the map to show up, made new items (i.e. annoying dog) to kill you instantly, etc.

3.) I was finished with my spritesheets and maps because I was given a deadline for my game 
progress and I tried sticking to it.

4.) Unfortuneatly I was not able to complete the game on time, for I still need a working 
antagonist (in case the annoying dog doesn't count), as well as a new menu, a new win screen, 
and a new lose screen.
