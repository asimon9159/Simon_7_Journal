Amanda Simon's Journal of 09/14/15:

The importance of organizing one's thoughts and not proceeding in a haphazard manner is that the student knows what he is doing, and know which direction he is proceeding in. If the
person is proceeding in a risky way, he could make several mistakes in which he does not know what to do. At the beginning of the class this year, we talked about how if you can't 
help another student, that means that you don't understand what to do yourself.
