1.) (Current) My orbs are invisible when the key is pressed/holded down. I believe that some stated 
variable that isVisible in the orb class was set to true, instead of false or something along the 
lines of that. I am determined to solve this problem today. 
2.) (Current) My enemies are not able to die when shot by the orb. 
3.) (Current) The orbs are not killing the enemies.
4.) (Current) The orbs are not moving across/around the princess.
5.) (Current) My enemies are not able to move yet.
6.) The game was not accepting player or Player. So, I had to change (P/p)layer to princessdie by:
          public static Player princessdie;
7.) (Current) I have problems getting the orb to spawn from my character's coordinates.
8.) (Current) I also have problems getting the orb to appear in the direction the user is facing.
9.) There were a few times where the character could not go right, but any other direction. This 
was solved by:
          if (cangoright
			&& (!(isBlocked(princessdie.x + SIZE + fdelta,

			princessdie.y) || isBlocked(princessdie.x + SIZE + fdelta, princessdie.y
10.) I also had trouble calling the orb picture from res/Orb/Ninja_#.png. It could not find the 
picture of the orb, but I soon realized that I just named the orbs differently, a minor "problem" 
that was easily fixable.
