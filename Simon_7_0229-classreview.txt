1.) You create a class with the basic template:
public class Element {
}
2.) That is not a class contructor, because a class constructor is a method inside a class that allows 
you to set the variables of that class and create instances of that class. This uses a class constructor 
to create an instance.
3.) public class Donut{
	int x, y;
	boolean isGlazed;
	boolean hasJelly;
	float temperature;
	public Donut (boolean a, boolean b, float c) {
		this.isGlazed = a;
		this.has Jelly = b;
		this.temperature = c;
	}
	//a getter gets, i.e., a getter returns a variable value
	//usually, a getter is a public method to get a private value
	public boolean getHasJelly(){
		return this.hasJelly;
	}
	public void setTemperature(float c){
		this.temperature = c;
	}
}
4.) A getter are methods that 'gets' values of instances.
	FamilyBreakfast.getBreakfast();
5.) A setter are methods that 'sets' values of instances.
	FamilyBreakfast.setBreakfast();
6.) An array of breakfast would include eggs, bacon, pancakes, coffee, etc. 
	int [] coolnumberz; //this is an array of integers
	String [] coolwords; //this is a string array
	boolean [] [] blocked; //this is a 2D array of booleans
	Breakfast [] FamilyBreakfast = new Breakfast;
