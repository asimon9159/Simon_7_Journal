The 2-D dungeon would have a wooden looking floor with stone cobble/tile walls that are equipped 
with light sources evenly spaced. Every room would have an item or an enemy, sometimes coming upon 
an empty room or an unique item. Some rooms will have a wooden door, which can be opened with a 
key that can be found in a room. The atmosphere would be dark/omnious while in a pixelated form. 
I want it to have an RPG feel to it, because it's been my dream to make a RPG game that I could 
be pround of.
