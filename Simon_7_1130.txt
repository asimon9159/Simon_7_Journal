I feel that my game was mostly successful (according to the rubric). I like how much my game came 
out to be in the end, even though I wanted: to tweek the dialouge; needed to add in *real* enemies 
besides a door that asks whether you push or pull; include interactive objects; and to include 
some easter eggs. But overall, I feel like I accomplished the main goal.
