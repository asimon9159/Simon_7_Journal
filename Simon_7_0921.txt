I only have 8/26/15 journal missing, yet every other journal grade is entered in.

It is important that you use the naming convention specified when naming files is because it is easier to search and/or identifiy the file.

The command in Linux to copy all of a directory to the current directory is: git all *
Then you type: git commmit -m "titletitletitle"
And finally type: git push -u origin master
(Enter git information)
