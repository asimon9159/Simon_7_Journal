1.) I could have made actual enemies that chased the player throughout the game. I also could have 
made the walking paths wider and the blocking blocks needed to be fix to where it accomodated the 
new walls.

2.) I constantly needed and, for the most part, got help for my blocking blocks as well as changing 
the stats of the enemies to where it's a threat to the player.
