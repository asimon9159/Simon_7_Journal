1.) With arduino, it doesn't have the same feel or you don't have the 
same knowledge as you did with netbeans. With netbeans, you are able 
to compare ideas and codes with your previous projects. But with 
arduino, you aren't given the same security or sensibility as you did 
with the comfortable netbeans like we've been more exposed to.

2.) It is definitely a new, and more difficult, program to use since 
this is our introduction to this. It will be hard to adjust to the 
change, but luckily, using prior knowledge and experience from netbeans, 
arduino will hopefully be more easier to understand and customize to. 
So even though arduino is a new light on the stage, it still can be 
easily comprehensible because of CS.

3.) In CS, you start to learn that everything must be organized and, 
if not placed in the order that it needs to appear in, will be messed 
up and around, which will confuse you and the project. It is difficult 
to know where to place which coding and it is difficult to find it. 
However, knowing your code and knowing what you are doing will help 
you guide through, but the more you interact with arduino and your 
program, the more experience you have and will gain.
