1.) You add an image to a slick game by referencing the image that should be inside the res 
folder of the game, by using the code [ Image Dog = new Image("res/annoyingdog.png"); ]

2.) The image is drawn in render/main when it is instansized, or called upon. 

for (Dog d : kennel) {
			if (d.isvisible) {
				d.currentImage.draw(d.x, d.y);
				// draw the hitbox
				//d.draw(d.hitbox);

			}
		}
