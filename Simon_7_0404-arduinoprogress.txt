1.) We have set up a definite goal for our projects, as well as set different frequencies 
for the our jukebox, and were able to create a title with the LCD. We have connected the 
LCD and are currently trying to connect and see how the LCD will be able to interact with 
the push buttons. Different notes have been added. Songs are currently being translated 
with different and created notes.

2.) We need to connect multiple buttons (at least 2) so that the user can scroll and 
select options on the LCD and create the different songs using our frequencies. The LEDs 
are to be connected at a later time in part that we believe it will cause the least 
trouble when synching it with the song notes. Need to finish translating the songs with 
the new notes soon. Will need to figure out how to use buttons to "scroll" on the LCD.

3.) At this point of time, we will be able to play a song, show the song title/jukebox 
name, and hopefully a LED that lights up with the song. By Friday, I can most definitely 
confirm that we will be able to produce multiple songs chosen by the user (however, not 
shown on the LCD just yet) and will have at least one LED that will blink along to one 
tone of the song (with goals of having multiple LEDs lighting up for different notes).

4.) The different frequencies, the user input for buttons, a mash of the LCD, buttons, 
tuner, and LED coding. If statements that would correspond with the user pushed-buttons 
that will identify which songs, presumably in methods, to pick. We have also changed 
how the LEDs will light and blink, and displays.

5.) The user will be able to scroll and select between songs (as for user input). The 
LCD will be able to show the song title and other details of the user chosen song. We 
are trying to create the function of a button choosing and playing the songs (i.e. 
button1 will play song1, button2 will play song2, etc.).
