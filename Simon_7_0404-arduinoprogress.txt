1.) We have set up a definite goal for our projects, as well as set different frequencies 
for the our jukebox, and were able to create a title with the LCD.
2.) We need to connect multiple buttons (at least 2) so that the user can scroll and 
select options on the LCD and create the different songs using our frequencies.
3.) At this point of time, we will be able to play a song, show the song title/jukebox 
name, and hopefully a LED that lights up with the song.
4.) The different frequencies, the user input for buttons, a mash of the LCD, buttons, 
tuner, and LED coding.
5.) The user will be able to scroll and select between songs (as for user input). The 
LCD will be able to show the song title and other details of the user chosen song.
