1.) We should revise and resubmit our game so that we can try to improve some areas (such as give 
a power to enemies, include another object that gives the user a(n) dis/advantage, etc.) or to 
"clean" up some codes (such as timers, if you don't want them). Revise a game is like revising an 
essay, there's always something to redo and edit.
