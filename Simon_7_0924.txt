Steve Ballmer called the GPL a virus because he said that the code released under GPL was uselss to the commercial area section, since it can only be used if the resulting 
surrounding code becomes GPL.

The difference between open source and proprietary software is that open source is public to everyone without no restrictions (with freedom), while proprietary software has terms to use and edit 
the software; they are opposite.

The differences between MIT and the GPL license is that MIT is about sharing and reusing with a license, while GPL is editing and running the software.
