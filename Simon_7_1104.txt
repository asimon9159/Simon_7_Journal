1.)A method opperates on the class as a whole for an object. It's catagorizes objects in the class.

2.)I use the methods to do certain actions like play again so that the game is organized.

3.)A while loop is a loop that functions "while" the program is running a specific method.

4.)I used a while loop, boolean, and counter in my guessing game by naming certain actions (such 
as playAgain) for booleans. For while loops, I ultilized it by placing it before the actual game 
command lines so that the user can be able to do something while still playing the game. A counter 
is used so that the user knows how many tries they have left or how many times you guessed right/
wrong.
