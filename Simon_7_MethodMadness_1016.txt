I plan to make the eyes more detailed (i.e. anime eyes), as well as decide whether or not I want the turtle to be a Ninja Turtle or just a regular 
turtle. If I make the turtle a Ninja Turtle, I'll add a headband, and possibly change the eyebrows. (Right now, the eyebrows are "Japanese Angry
Eyebrows", but other choices are "Worried Eyebrows", "Smaller, Not Japanese, Angry Eyebrows", and "Sarcastic Eyebrows") I plan to change the
background to something that looks like a lake shore with lake/swamp plants, or  underwater with bubbles coming from the turtles' mouth.

Right now, I have the main shell of a turtle, the feet, a head, simplistic eyes, opened gasping mouth, and half the scales on the shell. A very simple 
drawing of a turtle, but I'm hoping to make this a sweet/cute or make it a Ninja Turtle.
