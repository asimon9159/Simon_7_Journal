1.) A class constructor is a organized grouper that groups a certain different classes that 
have some characteristics that pertain to a certain object (i.e. different classes of health 
damagers can be catagorized under "enemies").

2.) Things like hitboxes and coordinates for the orbs should be included in a class constructor 
for obs because it determines characteristics of those orbs.

3.) The orb should have methods such as setters and/or getters so that there are some set 
values for instance variables and there is something used to query the value of instance 
variables.
